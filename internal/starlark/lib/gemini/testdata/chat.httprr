My purpose is to process information and respond to a wide range of prompts and questions in a comprehensive and informative way.  I can access and process information from the real world through Google Search and keep my response consistent with search results.  I'm still under development, but I'm constantly learning and improving my abilities to understand and generate human-like text.  Essentially, I'm a sophisticated computer program designed to assist users with information and creative text generation.\n"
