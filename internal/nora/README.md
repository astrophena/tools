Nora is a simple interpreted scripting language, designed to be embedded in my
personal tools.

It has a C-like syntax, supports variable bindings, prefix and infix operators,
has first-class and higher-order functions, can handle closures with ease and
has integers, booleans, arrays and hashes built-in.

It built with help of [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com) book.
